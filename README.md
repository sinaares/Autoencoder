Movie Recommendation with Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE)
This project implements a movie recommendation system using a Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE) built with PyTorch. It uses the MovieLens dataset to predict user ratings and recommend movies.

Features
Deep learning-based collaborative filtering

Neural network trained with user-movie rating data

Uses PyTorch for model building and training

Works with the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets

How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sinaares/Autoencoder.git

Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the training script:
python main.py

Make sure to download the MovieLens datasets and place them in the correct folders (ml-100k/ and ml-1m/ as used in the script).
